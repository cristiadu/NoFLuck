# No F. Luck
A Web Scrapping Application that gets a specific group from the NFL Pick'em on ESPN, and analyze data extracted from there.

## Introduction
It was built back in 2015 just as a tool for the players on a particular ESPN Pick'em group to analyze their own picks in terms of "which team am I picking too much and always loses?" and so forth.

It uses AngularJS and Jquery, and is maintained just in terms of code quality nowadays, as we used Yahoo Query Language (YQL) here and that's not available anymore, as well as the ESPN website layout changed considerably after a few years.

## Running
